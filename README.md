Canon Camera Command Program based on EDSDK

This is the full and working Delphi source to command a canon DSLR from your computer. Working functions include:

- setting exposure properties
- shooting
- live View
- zoom and navigation during live view
- focusing during live view
- custom file naming

Not working is showing RAW-files as image (tip me if you know how it can be done - I know it should be possible!).


The application is geared towards shooting a stack of pictures by driving the focusing motor of the lens. The underlying object model is completely generic though.

* Tested ONLY with canon Eos 7D mk 1
* Delphi 7; Windows xp
